# Thank You Rocket Rs
A message reception web server that allows a person to connect, write a message, and have it be stored on the server. 
The messages are viewable only to the user who sent them, and the server host.

At the moment, the actual ui displayed to the user is pretty bare bones, I don't plan on going super far with it at the moment.
